# Go Implementation (Incomplete)

This directory contains a partial Go implementation of the `pulumi-oneblood`
provider. It only includes a small skeleton component and minimal tests. The
Python implementation under `provider/` remains the authoritative version.

This skeleton is provided as a starting point for a full rewrite in Go.
